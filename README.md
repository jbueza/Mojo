# Mojo - JavaScript Microframework

Mojo is a lightweight structural JavaScript framework that has the ability to scale up and down based on how big your project is.  In trying to keep the same structural essence of its predecessor, we're refactoring its core features into jQuery plugins.

jQuery is a great library that encompasses a plethora of helper methods (animation, DOM manipulation, network IO) but it doesn't reinforce the concepts of writing code with structural integrity or implementation silos. Having globally distributed software development teams, we found that using jQuery alone can quickly turn a project into a pile of spaghetti with developers hopping on and off the project.

The Mojo Initiative emerged to help distributed teams build web applications with a set of consistent APIs, implementation silos, loosely bound code, and structural integrity.

### Building From Source

<pre>
  $ git clone git@github.com:jbueza/Mojo.git &amp;&amp; cd Mojo
  $ ant
</pre>

## Getting Setup

1. git clone http://github.com/jbueza/Mojo.git && cd Mojo
2. use apache ant to build a compiled source: <code>ant</code>
3. navigate to the <code>/example</code> to view the example code

### app.js: Maps elements to Controllers

``` javascript
var app = mojo.create({ baseSrc: 'js/' });

app
  .configure('appSrc', 'js/')
  .configure('locale', 'en_US')                   // locale aware applications! (load different languages)
  .configure('environment', 'prod')               // dev or prod for debugging mode!
  .configure('pluginSrc', 'js/lib/plugins/')      // setup plugins location directory
  .configure('plugins', ['jqmodal', 'jcarousel']) // automagically fetch my jQuery plugins!

  .map('#registration-example', [{ controller: "ExampleApp.RegistrationController", params: { user: 123, firstName: "Johnson" }} ])

  .map('#login-example', [{ controller: "ExampleApp.LoginController" }])

  .start()
```

### mysite/User/RegistrationController.js

```javascript

/*
 * Registration Controller
 */
mojo.define("mysite.User.RegistrationController", function($) {
  var Controller = {
    methods: {
      
    },
    events: []
  };
  
  return Controller;
});
```

### Technical Features

* Aspect-oriented programming for intercepting functionality (before and after)
* Dependency injection on any plugin or Controller
* Publish/Subscribe (mojo.Messaging.publish/subscribe)
* Use any other jQuery plugin (jqModal for dialogs, jcarousel for carousels, bbq for History, etc)
* Controllers are mapped to DOM elements to give components functionality -- allowing you to easily feature-gate
* Controllers are used as a way of creating implementation silos (Login Controller, Registration Controller, Chat Controller, Profile Controller, etc)

## Why use Mojo?

* Mojo offers a foundation that other libraries and developers can take advantage of. It was built to provide a consistent architectural structure for development of small to massive projects allowing for code reuse and flexibility

* Enforces organization and clean separation of code to ease readability and maintainability

* Capability to pull any jQuery plugin for rapid prototyping and development
 
* Increases productivity of large teams working in parallel, particularly on Agile projects, by dividing work into implementation silos and allowing incremental development

* Reduces developer ramp-up time starting on new projects because they are already accustomed to the coding structures, patterns and practices

* Development speeds up as times goes on compared to the opposite that happens when code becomes too tightly bound

## Contributing

* Discuss large changes on Issues View before coding
* Javascript code style
  * has two space indention
  * maximum 80 column width
  * keywords followed by open-paren must be separated by a space. eg. if (condition) not if(condition)
  * no space between function name and open paren e.g. functionName(parameters) not functionName (parameters)
  * multi-line if statements must have braces.
* patches should all pass [JSLint](http://jslint.com)
